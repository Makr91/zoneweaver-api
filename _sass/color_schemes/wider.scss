// Custom color scheme for wider layout with dark theme
// Based on Just the Docs official method for wider content

// Import dark theme first (official path from Just the Docs docs)
@import "./color_schemes/dark";

// Then override the width
$content-width: 60rem;  // Much wider than default 50rem for Swagger UI
